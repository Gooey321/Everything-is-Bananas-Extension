# Everything is Bananas Extension
 This google chrome extension turns all images in google chrome into bananas!

# How to install:
 Just download the Everything-is-Bananas-Extension folder and go into google chrome and type "chrome://extensions/" and turn on Developer mode in the top right corner if you haven't already. Then click "Load unpacked" and select the Everything-is-Bananas-Extension folder. Then, in the top right, above the developer mode toggle button click on the puzzle piece and pin the Banana.

# How to use:
 On a webpage with images, (for example just search "images" in google and click on the images tab to switch to images) click on the banana image and choose what image you want to change the icon too. Then click submit. You should see all the images change into the selected banana.

*note: The banana extension can only change the images that are already loaded. So if you scroll down you will have to repeat the image changing process*

*note: This is my first github project*

*note: Some images inside webpages do not work*
